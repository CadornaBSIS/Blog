          Attending the MLBB - BATTLETRIPS event by Moonton on September 21,
          2024, was an unforgettable experience that gave me a rare
          behind-the-scenes look into the world of professional eSports. I had
          the chance to meet top-tier Mobile Legends players and learn about
          their training and dedication. The event included a VIP pass that
          allowed me to watch MPL pro players compete up close, feeling the
          intense energy of the arena. One of the most impressive parts was the
          exclusive tour of the backstage area, where I saw the vast technical
          infrastructure that supports the tournament, from the massive screens
          and complex setups to the numerous computers handling the game data,
          Wi-Fi, and tournament logistics. It was amazing to witness the
          coordination and effort required to ensure everything runs smoothly,
          deepening my appreciation for the world of competitive gaming.
