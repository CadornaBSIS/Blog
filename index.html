          <h3>Hobby</h3>

          <p>
            Playing Mobile Legends is one of my favorite hobbies because it
            helps me relax and have fun after a busy day. When I play, I can
            forget about my schoolwork and just enjoy the game. It’s also a
            great way to spend time with my friends. We play together, work as a
            team, and have fun chatting during the game. These moments help us
            bond and make our friendship stronger. For me, it’s not just about
            winning, but about having a good time with friends and enjoying the
            game together. It’s a simple way to relax and connect with the
            people I care about.

          <h3>Business</h3>
          <p>
            With my experience in Mobile Legends tournaments and strong gameplay
            skills, I started a business where I help players reach high ranks
            like Immortal by piloting their accounts and improving their
            rankings. I also sell premium and regular Starlight cards, offering
            exclusive in-game benefits. Through diamonds earned in tournaments,
            I exchange them for valuable items that I can sell. This business
            allows me to combine my passion for the game with an entrepreneurial
            spirit, helping others enjoy the game while making a profit from my
            achievements and in-game sales.

          <h3>Joining Tournaments</h3>
          <p>
            One of my best experiences in Mobile Legends was winning the
            champion title in the Technological University of the Philippines -
            Manila tournament on September 30, 2023. I didn’t expect to win, but
            it made me really happy and taught me valuable lessons about
            teamwork, strategy, and staying calm under pressure. This experience
            has motivated me to keep improving my skills and showed me that hard
            work leads to success. It also inspired me to pursue more
            competitive opportunities in the future and helped build my
            confidence in the game.

          <h3>Editing</h3>
          <p>
            I also enjoy editing videos, and one of my memorable experiences was
            on October 12, 2024, when I edited a video for a Mobile Legends
            event. The video showcased a competitive tournament in the community
            and highlighted the school's tournament connected to MLBB. It also
            featured pictures from my battle trip and shared my experience of
            watching the live MPL event at the venue. This video editing project
            allowed me to combine my love for Mobile Legends with my creative
            skills, capturing the excitement and energy of the event for others
            to enjoy.

          winning made me really happy and proud. It taught me important lessons
          about teamwork, strategy, and staying calm under pressure. This
          experience has encouraged me to keep improving my skills and showed me
          that with hard work, you can achieve things you don’t expect.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a third-year student at the Technological University of the
        Philippines (TUP) - Manila, where I’m studying Information Systems. I
        really enjoy my classes and the interesting things I’m learning about
        technology and how it works. In my free time, I love playing mobile
        games like Mobile Legends. Gaming is a fun way for me to relax and
        connect with friends. I also enjoy running every day. It helps me stay
        fit and gives me a chance to clear my mind after a long day of studying.
        I consider myself a friendly person, and I’m always happy to listen to
        others. I believe that good conversations are important for building
        strong friendships. In terms of my studies, I have been learning
        programming languages like C, C++, and Java for about three years now. I
        know I still have a lot to learn, but I’m eager to keep improving my
        skills and apply what I learn in real-world situations. I’m excited
        about my future and the opportunities ahead of me. Thanks for taking the
        time to read about me!
